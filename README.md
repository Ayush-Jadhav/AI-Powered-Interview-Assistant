# AI-Powered Interview Assistant

An intelligent, full-stack application designed to automate the initial screening process for technical interviews. This tool provides a seamless experience for both the candidate (interviewee) and the hiring manager (interviewer), powered by the Google Gemini API.

The application features a timed, AI-driven chat interview for candidates and a comprehensive dashboard for interviewers to review results, scores, and AI-generated summaries.

## Features

### For the Interviewee:
- ** Resume Upload:** Candidates can upload their resume (PDF format supported).
- ** Automatic Info Extraction:** The system automatically parses the resume to extract the candidate's Name, Email, and Phone Number.
- ** AI-Powered Chat Interview:** A timed interview session with 6 questions dynamically generated by the Gemini API.
- ** Progressive Difficulty:** The interview consists of 2 Easy, 2 Medium, and 2 Hard questions tailored for a Full Stack (React/Node.js) role.
- ** Timed Questions:** Each question has a specific time limit (20s for Easy, 60s for Medium, 120s for Hard) to simulate a real-world pressure environment.
- ** Session Persistence:** If the candidate accidentally closes the tab, they can resume the interview from where they left off, thanks to a "Welcome Back" feature.

### For the Interviewer:
- ** Centralized Dashboard:** View a list of all candidates, sortable by their final AI-generated score.
- ** Detailed Review:** Click on any candidate to see a detailed breakdown of their interview, including:
  - Full chat history (all questions and answers).
  - The AI-generated score for each answer.
  - A final, concise summary of the candidate's performance, generated by the AI.
- ** Search Functionality:** Easily search for specific candidates.

### Running the Application

This project requires two terminals to run simultaneously: one for the backend server and one for the frontend React app.

1.  **Start the Backend Server (in Terminal 1):**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    *(You should see ` API Server is running at http://localhost:3001`)*

2.  **Start the Frontend App (in Terminal 2):**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    *(This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`)*
